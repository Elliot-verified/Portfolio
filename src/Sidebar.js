      <p>Hi, I’m Elliot.
I’m a proud New Yorker living in Brooklyn with my girlfriend, Tatiana. I enjoy reading about Biology, economics, neuroscience, and philosophy and writing about emergent phenomena of modern tech. I also like going to stand up comedy and doing action sports (surfing, snowboarding, rock climbing.) I work in product analytics and learn about genetics in the evenings. </p>
